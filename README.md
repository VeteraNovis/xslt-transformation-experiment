# XSLT Transformation Experiment
This project was started to explore the XSLT language and play around with transforming XML data into HTML.  I generated some sample XML data to simulate a catalog of books and used XSLT to extract the data from the XML file.  When combined with HTML and CSS the data is presented in a clean, useful format.

## Transformed Data

See below for a screenshot of the XML file after XSLT and CSS has been applied.
